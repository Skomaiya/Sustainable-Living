            <h3>Renewable Energy Solutions</h3>
            <p>Explore the various types of renewable energy sources, their benefits, and how they can be implemented to
                reduce reliance on fossil fuels and mitigate climate change.</p>

            <h3>Harnessing Renewable Energy</h3>
            <p>Renewable energy refers to energy that comes from resources that are naturally replenished on a human
                timescale, such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves, and geothermal heat. Unlike fossil fuels,
                renewable energy sources are abundant, sustainable, and have a much lower environmental impact.</p>

            <h2>Types of Renewable Energy</h2>

            <h2>Solar Energy</h2>
            <p>Solar energy is harnessed using photovoltaic cells that convert sunlight directly into electricity. Solar
                panels can be installed on rooftops, in open fields, or integrated into building materials. The
                technology has become more efficient and affordable, making it a viable option for many households and
                businesses.</p>

            <h2>Wind Energy</h2>
            <p>Wind energy is captured using wind turbines that convert the kinetic energy of wind into mechanical
                power, which can then be converted into electricity. Wind farms can be located on land or offshore,
                taking advantage of the stronger and more consistent winds found over oceans and seas.</p>

            <h2>Hydropower</h2>
            <p>Hydropower generates electricity by using the energy of moving water. Dams are often built to control
                water flow, creating reservoirs that release water through turbines to produce electricity. While
                hydropower is a well-established technology, it is essential to consider the environmental and social
                impacts of dam construction.</p>

            <h2>Biomass Energy</h2>
            <p>Biomass energy is derived from organic materials such as plant and animal waste. These materials can be
                burned directly for heat or converted into biofuels for transportation and electricity generation.
                Biomass energy helps reduce waste and can be a sustainable energy source if managed responsibly.</p>

            <h2>Geothermal Energy</h2>
            <p>Geothermal energy harnesses the heat from the Earth's interior. This heat can be used directly for
                heating buildings or to generate electricity through geothermal power plants. Geothermal energy is
                highly efficient and reliable, but its availability is limited to regions with suitable geological
                conditions.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The transition to renewable energy is crucial for mitigating climate change and reducing our dependence
                on fossil fuels. This course will provide an in-depth understanding of the different types of renewable
                energy, their benefits, and practical steps for implementing renewable energy solutions in various
                contexts.</p>
